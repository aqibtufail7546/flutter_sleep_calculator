# 🛌 Flutter Sleep Calculator App

A Flutter app that helps you find the best times to sleep or wake up based on the natural 90-minute sleep cycle. Inspired by sleepcalculator.com
, this app makes it easy to wake up feeling refreshed.

# ✨ Features

⏰ Two calculation modes:

Enter a wake-up time → get suggested bedtimes.

Enter a bedtime (or choose “Go to bed now”) → get suggested wake-up times.

🧠 Smart sleep cycle logic:

Each sleep cycle = 90 minutes.

Adds a 15-minute buffer for falling asleep.

Suggests 4–6 times so you can choose what works best.

🎨 Modern UI:

Built with Material 3 (Material You).

Dark & Light mode support.

Clean, minimal design with card-based results.

📱 Cross-platform:

Works on Android, iOS, and Web.
